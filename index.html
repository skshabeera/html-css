        <p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς, "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.

        <p>Would environmental damage be reduced by replacing beef with mycoprotein produced in cell culture? Modelling shows that this change could greatly cut global deforestation, pasture area and greenhouse-gas emissions.
